Pizza is a beloved Italian dish featuring a baked, flat dough base with tomato sauce, cheese, and various toppings,
originating in Naples but now a global favorite, known for its simple roots as a food for the working class that evolved
into a culinary staple with endless regional variations, like the Margherita (tomato, mozzarella, basil) named for
royalty and the hearty Meat Lover's pizza loaded with assorted meats. Its versatility allows for countless combinations of ingredients,
making it a dish that can be customized to suit any taste preference.
